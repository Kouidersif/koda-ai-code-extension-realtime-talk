# Zexo AI - Your AI Code Companion

Transform your coding experience with voice-powered AI assistance. Zexo AI provides intelligent, context-aware help through natural voice conversations while you code.

## ✨ Features

- **🎤 Voice Interaction**: Talk to your code like you're pair programming with an expert
- **🧠 Smart Context**: Automatically understands what you're working on
- **💬 Copilot Integration**: Enhanced GitHub Copilot commands for quick explanations and reviews
- **🎯 Privacy-Focused**: Only shares context when active, with automatic secret redaction
- **⚡ Real-time**: Instant voice responses with low-latency audio streaming
- **🔒 Secure**: No data stored locally, full control over what's shared

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Install** the extension from VS Code Marketplace
2. **Start coding**: Click the ✨ sparkle icon in the status bar!

## 💻 How to Use

### Status Bar

Look for the **✨ sparkle icon** in the bottom-right corner:
- **✨** = Ready (click to activate)
- **✨~** = Listening & active
- **✨ 🔇** = Muted

Just click the icon to start or stop Zexo AI.

### Voice Commands

Once active, simply speak to ask questions:
- "What does this function do?"
- "Is there a bug here?"
- "How can I improve this code?"
- "Explain this to me"

## 📋 What Gets Shared

When Zexo AI is **active**, it automatically shares:
- Selected code snippets
- Current file context (~40 lines around cursor)
- File metadata (name, language, line count)
- Project structure (on session start)

**When stopped**: Nothing is shared. Your code stays private.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- ✅ **On-demand only**: Shares context only when active
- ✅ **No local storage**: Nothing saved on your machine
- ✅ **Size limits**: Max 20KB per context payload
- ✅ **Instant control**: Stop anytime with one click

## 🎯 Use Cases

**Learning**: Understand unfamiliar code
```
Select a complex function → Ask "How does this work?"
```

**Debugging**: Find issues quickly
```
Select suspicious code → Ask "Is there a bug here?"
```

**Code Review**: Get instant feedback
```
Use "Copilot: Review Current File" command
```

**Refactoring**: Get improvement suggestions
```
Select code → Ask "How can I make this better?"
```

**Accessibility**: Code hands-free
```
Use voice commands instead of typing
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Extension won't start**
→ Ensure the extension is activated via the status bar icon or command palette

**No audio**
→ Verify microphone permissions in System Preferences/Settings

**Context not working**
→ Make sure Zexo AI is active (✨~ icon in status bar)

**Connection errors**
→ Confirm VS Code is online and retry activating the extension

## 💡 Tips

- **Select code first** before asking questions for better context
- **Keep Zexo AI running** while working on a feature for continuous assistance
- **Use mute** when you need quiet but want to keep context sharing active
- **Combine with Copilot** for the best AI-assisted coding experience
